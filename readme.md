the fisrt version is easy,all most all the codes are in index.js with modules.
I complete it based on '深入浅出nodejs' of '扑灵' .now i am reading the book.

frameXu.js is the first version of my webframe.if you have the environment of node, you just need
to node createServer.js.in the directory of test is my own test during the developing.
